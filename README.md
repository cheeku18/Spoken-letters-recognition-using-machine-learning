# Spoken-letters-recognition-using-machine-learning

In this work, the goal/ task was to classify the English letter spoken by the subject. A variety of speakers had to speak each alphabet twice and extracted features such as spectral coefficients, contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features were used in this task of classification. In this work, clustering and classification techniques were applied in classifying the English letter spoken. A multitude of feature selection/ reduction techniques were applied, and the machine learners were tuned for hyper-parameters using grid search techniques. Any evidence of overfitting was dealt with in this approach and since the dataset had 617 attributes, principal component analysis â€“ a dimensionality reduction technique was also applied. As a result, a random forest classifier capable of classifying the spoken letters with 92.7% accuracy was built.
